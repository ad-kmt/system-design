# Understanding Cookies

## What are Cookies on Websites?

Cookies are small files of information generated by a web server and sent to a web browser. Web browsers store these cookies for a predetermined period or the length of a user's session on a website. Cookies are then included in future HTTP requests made by the user's browser, enabling websites to personalize the user experience and perform necessary functions like authentication.

## Where are Cookies Stored?

Web browsers store cookies in a designated file on the user's device. For instance, Google Chrome stores all cookies in a file labeled "Cookies." Users can view these stored cookies by accessing the developer tools in their browser, navigating to the "Application" tab, and selecting "Cookies" from the menu.

## What are Cookies Used For?

Cookies serve various purposes, including:

### User Sessions
Cookies help associate website activity with a specific user.

For example, when a user logs into a shopping website, the server generates a session cookie that allows the site to recognize the user and maintain their session across different pages.

### Personalization
Cookies enable websites to remember user actions or preferences, enhancing the personalized experience.

For example, a website can remember a user's login name for future visits.

### Tracking
Cookies can record the websites users visit, aiding in targeted advertising and analytics. Tracking cookies collect user activity data and send it to the originating server, which can be used for personalized advertisements or anonymous analytics.

## Types of Cookies

Understanding the different types of cookies is essential:

### Session Cookies
These cookies track a user's session and are deleted after the session ends, such as when the user logs out or exits the website. Session cookies do not have an expiration date.

### Persistent Cookies
Persistent cookies remain in the user's browser for a set period, which can range from days to years. They always include an expiration date.

### Authentication Cookies
These cookies manage user sessions by associating user account information with a cookie identifier. They ensure that sensitive information is delivered to the correct user.

### Tracking Cookies
Generated by tracking services, these cookies record user activity and send it to the tracking service when the browser loads a website using that service.

### Zombie Cookies
Zombie cookies regenerate after being deleted by creating backup versions outside the browser's typical cookie storage. These are often used by unscrupulous ad networks or cyber attackers.

## What is a Third-Party Cookie?

A third-party cookie belongs to a domain other than the one displayed in the browser. These cookies are primarily used for tracking and contrast with first-party cookies, which are associated with the same domain shown in the browser. For example, while a session cookie from `jeans.example.com` is a first-party cookie, a tracking cookie from `example.ad-network.com` stored during the same session is a third-party cookie.

## How Do Cookies Affect User Privacy?

Cookies can record browsing activity, which raises privacy concerns for many users who do not want their online behavior tracked. Users often lack control over how tracking services use the collected data. Privacy laws like the EU's ePrivacy Directive and GDPR regulate cookie usage, requiring user consent and treating cookie identifiers as personal data.

### Privacy Laws and Regulations
- **EU's ePrivacy Directive**: Requires user consent for cookie usage except for those necessary for website functionality.
- **GDPR**: Treats cookie identifiers as personal data, applying strict rules to their usage within the EU.

Consequently, many websites now display cookie banners allowing users to review and control the cookies used.
