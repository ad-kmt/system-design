# Forward Proxy

## What is Forward Proxy?

A forward proxy (also known as a proxy or proxy server) is a server that sits in front of a group of clients. When a client sends a request to a server, instead of going directly to the server, the request is routed to the forward proxy, which then forwards the request to the server.

In other words, when clients send requests to websites on the Internet, the forward proxy intercepts these requests and communicates with the servers on behalf of the clients (acting as an intermediary). This can help us perform certain actions before the request reaches the original destination.

## Why do we use a Forward Proxy?

There are several reasons to use a forward proxy:

- **Filtering Network Traffic**: A forward proxy can filter network traffic based on predefined rules. For example, an organization can use a proxy server to block access to specific websites or restrict access to certain types of content. It can also enforce security policies and protect against malicious activities.

- **Providing Anonymity**: Forward proxies can provide anonymity for clients by hiding their IP addresses. This can be useful for accessing content that is restricted in certain regions or for protecting clients' privacy and security.

- **Optimizing Network Traffic**: Forward proxies can optimize network traffic by compressing data, removing unnecessary headers, and reducing the size of transferred data. This reduces bandwidth usage and improves network performance.

## How Does a Forward Proxy Work?

A forward proxy acts as more than just a traffic controller. As an intermediary, it can shield users from direct access to or from malicious actors, preventing them from compromising data and enterprise resources. It operates inline, sitting directly in the flow of traffic, allowing an organization to identify security challenges and enforce needed policies in real time.

Proxies act as buffers to help keep applications and data safe from harm, whether due to user errors or malicious activities like data exfiltration and malware.

## Forward Proxy vs. Traditional Firewall

A forward proxy differs from traditional firewalls in two key ways:

1. **Traffic Inspection**: Traditional firewalls use a passthrough approach, forwarding traffic to the intended recipient while inspecting its contents. If the traffic is found to be unsafe, the firewall sends an alert, which might be too late. A forward proxy, on the other hand, doesn’t forward traffic until it has been authenticated and deemed safe.

2. **Handling Encrypted Traffic**: Cloud-based forward proxies can inspect encrypted traffic. Most of today’s traffic is encrypted, and visibility into it is critical. However, decrypting, inspecting, and re-encrypting traffic is compute-intensive. Appliance-based firewalls with processing limitations can’t handle a high volume of encryption without adding latency, whereas a cloud firewall can.

## Forward Proxy vs. Reverse Proxy

It's easy to confuse forward and reverse proxies, so let's break them down:

- **Forward Proxy**: Sits in front of client endpoints to intercept incoming requests, ensuring no servers communicate directly with the client (e.g., a web browser). Forward proxies usually rely on a software agent installed on endpoints to forward traffic.

- **Reverse Proxy**: Sits in front of a web server to ensure no clients communicate directly with the server. It often includes a load balancer to optimize client requests, promote high availability, and improve load times by taking pressure off the backend server. Reverse proxies can cache content from an origin server to serve clients without further transactions with the server (web acceleration) and distribute requests among multiple origin servers to ensure even server loads.

## Why a Forward Proxy Is Needed Today

The old way of securing networks, known as the secure perimeter model, aimed to block bad traffic from entering the internal network. However, with the rise of cloud applications and remote work, this approach is no longer effective. Users now connect from many different locations to access private apps, SaaS, and public cloud data, making the old model inefficient and risky.

To ensure fast, direct, and secure connections, it's crucial to use a forward proxy that takes advantage of the cloud's performance and scalability.

## Forward Proxy Use Cases

### Shadow IT Discovery

With the spread of cloud usage across various applications, user groups, and locations, it can be hard to keep track of what users are accessing. A forward proxy connected to a Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) monitors and logs all traffic from approved user devices, helping IT identify and control access to unauthorized apps.

### Data Protection

SaaS apps make sharing fast and easy, but this can lead to users uploading important business data to unsafe locations. A cloud-based forward proxy prevents this by checking all traffic and hiding IP addresses, ensuring sensitive information isn't sent to risky destinations.

### Threat Prevention

SaaS apps can spread malware quickly due to their sharing capabilities. A forward proxy uses advanced threat protection (ATP) and cloud sandboxing to stop infected files from being uploaded to cloud resources by catching threats as they move.
