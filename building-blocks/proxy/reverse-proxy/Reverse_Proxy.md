# Reverse Proxy

## What is a Reverse Proxy?

A reverse proxy is a web server that centralizes internal services and provides unified interfaces to the public. It sits between clients and web servers, forwarding client requests to the appropriate server and returning the server's response to the client. This setup provides an additional level of abstraction and control to ensure the smooth flow of network traffic between clients and servers.

### Key Functions of a Reverse Proxy

- **Forwarding Requests:** Accepts requests from clients and forwards them to a server that can fulfill them, then returns the server's response to the client.
- **Security:** Hides information about backend servers, blacklists IPs, and limits the number of connections per client.
- **Scalability and Flexibility:** Clients only see the reverse proxy's IP, allowing for scalable and configurable server management.
- **SSL Termination:** Decrypts incoming requests and encrypts server responses, eliminating the need for X.509 certificates on each server.
- **Compression and Caching:** Compresses server responses and caches responses for improved performance.
- **Static Content Delivery:** Serves static content directly, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, photos, and videos.

## Why Use a Reverse Proxy?

- **Increased Security:** Protects backend servers from direct access and potential exploits. Helps defend against DDoS attacks by rejecting traffic from specific IP addresses and limiting connection numbers.
- **Enhanced Scalability:** Allows changes in backend server configurations without impacting clients, and supports dynamic scaling to handle traffic fluctuations.
- **Web Acceleration:** Improves performance through SSL acceleration, intelligent compression, and caching.
- **Unified Access Control:** Enforces web application security and enables federated security services for multiple applications.

## How Does a Reverse Proxy Work?

A reverse proxy can act as a simple forwarding service or a full proxy that separates client and server connections. In a full proxy setup, the reverse proxy creates independent connections to the client and server, ensuring no blending of connections. This bi-directional setup provides better control and security.

## Reverse Proxy vs. Load Balancer

### Load Balancer

- **Function:** Distributes incoming client requests among a group of servers to optimize resource use and ensure fast responses.
- **Use Case:** Deployed when multiple servers are needed to handle high traffic volumes, preventing a single point of failure.
- **Operation:** Servers host the same content, and the load balancer distributes the workload efficiently.

### Reverse Proxy

- **Function:** Forwards client requests to appropriate servers and returns responses to clients.
- **Use Case:** Useful even with a single server, providing benefits like security, scalability, and web acceleration.
- **Operation:** Acts as the public face of the website, managing traffic and requests seamlessly.

## Disadvantages of Using a Reverse Proxy

- **Increased Complexity:** Introducing a reverse proxy adds complexity to the network setup.
- **Single Point of Failure:** A single reverse proxy can become a single point of failure. Configuring multiple reverse proxies for failover increases complexity further.

## Conclusion

Reverse proxies play a crucial role in modern web architectures, providing enhanced security, scalability, and performance. They are essential for managing traffic efficiently and protecting backend servers.
