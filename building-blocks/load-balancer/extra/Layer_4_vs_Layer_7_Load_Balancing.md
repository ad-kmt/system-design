# Layer 4 vs Layer 7 Load Balancing

## What is Layer 4?
Layer 4 corresponds to the transport layer in the OSI model. Protocols like TCP and UDP operate at this layer.

## What is Layer 7?
Layer 7 corresponds to the application layer in the OSI model. This layer handles protocols such as HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and DNS.

## What is Layer 4 Load Balancing?
Layer 4 load balancing involves making routing decisions based on IP addresses and TCP or UDP ports. The load balancer views traffic at the packet level, making decisions for each packet independently.

### Characteristics of Layer 4 Load Balancers:
- **Routing Decisions**: Based on IPs and TCP/UDP ports.
- **Connection**: Direct connection between the client and server.
- **Speed**: Very fast, often utilizing ASICs for routing decisions.
- **Limitations**: Cannot perform actions above Layer 4 protocols.

## What is Layer 7 Load Balancing?
A layer 7 load balancer makes routing decisions based on IPs, TCP or UDP ports, or any information it can get from the application protocol (mainly HTTP).

The layer 7 load-balancer acts as a proxy, which means it maintains two TCP connections: one with the client and one with the server. The packets are re-assembled, and then the load balancer can make a routing decision based on the information it can find in the application requests or responses.

### Characteristics of Layer 7 Load Balancers:
- **Routing Decisions**: Based on IPs, TCP/UDP ports, and application layer information.
- **Connection**: Acts as a proxy, maintaining two TCP connections (one with the client and one with the server).
- **Speed**: Slightly slower due to packet re-assembly but still efficient (less than a millisecond).
- **Capabilities**: Can perform complex actions based on application-level data.

## Architectures with Layer 4 Load Balancers
There are three primary architectures for Layer 4 load balancers, depending on the needs:

1. **NAT (Routed)**
2. **Direct Server Return (Gateway)**
3. **IP Tunnel**

## Architectures with Layer 7 Load Balancers
Layer 7 load balancers primarily operate in proxy mode, with two main variations:

1. **Proxy**
2. **Transparent Proxy**

## Summary
- **Layer 4 Load Balancing**: Fast, packet-based routing decisions, limited to transport layer protocols.
- **Layer 7 Load Balancing**: More sophisticated, application-aware routing decisions, slightly slower but with more capabilities.
