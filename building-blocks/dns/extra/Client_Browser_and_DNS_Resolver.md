# How Does a Browser Know Which DNS Resolver to Contact?

When a browser needs to resolve a domain name to an IP address, it typically follows these steps to determine which DNS resolver to contact:

1. **Local Cache**: The browser first checks its own cache to see if it has recently resolved the domain name. If the IP address is found in the local cache and is still valid, it is used immediately.

2. **Operating System Cache**: If the browser does not have the IP address cached, it queries the operating system's DNS cache.

3. **Network Configuration**:
    - **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**: Most devices on a network receive their network configuration, including the IP address of the DNS resolver, from a DHCP server. This is common in home networks, corporate networks, and public Wi-Fi.
    - **Manual Configuration**: Alternatively, a user or network administrator can manually configure the DNS resolver settings in the device's network settings.

4. **Router Cache**: If the operating system does not have the answer, the request is typically forwarded to the DNS resolver specified in the network settings. This is often the local router, which may also cache DNS results.

5. **ISP DNS Resolver**: If the router does not have the information cached, it forwards the request to the DNS resolver provided by the Internet Service Provider (ISP). This is the most common setup for home users.

6. **Custom DNS Resolvers**: Some users or organizations configure their devices to use custom DNS resolvers, such as Google's Public DNS (`8.8.8.8`), Cloudflare's DNS (`1.1.1.1`), or OpenDNS. These settings override the default DNS resolver provided by the ISP.

The process ensures that the DNS query is handled efficiently by leveraging caching at multiple levels before reaching out to an external DNS resolver. This multi-tier caching mechanism helps reduce latency and network traffic.
