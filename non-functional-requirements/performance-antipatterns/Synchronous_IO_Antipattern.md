# Synchronous I/O Antipattern

## Problem Description

A synchronous I/O operation blocks the calling thread while the I/O completes. The calling thread enters a wait state and is unable to perform useful work during this interval, wasting processing resources.

### Common Examples of I/O

- Retrieving or persisting data to a database or any type of persistent storage.
- Sending a request to a web service.
- Posting a message or retrieving a message from a queue.
- Writing to or reading from a local file.

### Causes of the Antipattern

This antipattern typically occurs because:

- It appears to be the most intuitive way to perform an operation.
- The application requires a response from a request.
- The application uses a library that only provides synchronous methods for I/O.
- An external library performs synchronous I/O operations internally. A single synchronous I/O call can block an entire call chain.

### Impact

Blocking the calling thread while I/O completes can reduce performance and affect vertical scalability.

## How to Fix the Problem

Replace synchronous I/O operations with asynchronous operations. This approach frees the current thread to continue performing meaningful work rather than blocking, improving the utilization of compute resources. Performing I/O asynchronously is particularly efficient for handling an unexpected surge in requests from client applications.

### Asynchronous Operations

Many libraries provide both synchronous and asynchronous versions of methods. Whenever possible, use the asynchronous versions. For libraries that don't provide asynchronous versions of operations, it may be possible to create asynchronous wrappers around selected synchronous methods.

#### Considerations for Asynchronous Wrappers

Follow this approach with caution. While it may improve responsiveness on the thread that invokes the asynchronous wrapper, it actually consumes more resources. An extra thread may be created, and there is overhead associated with synchronizing the work done by this thread.

### Considerations

I/O operations that are expected to be very short lived and are unlikely to cause contention might be more performant as synchronous operations. An example might be reading small files on a solid-state drive (SSD) drive. The overhead of dispatching a task to another thread, and synchronizing with that thread when the task completes, might outweigh the benefits of asynchronous I/O. However, these cases are relatively rare, and most I/O operations should be done asynchronously.

Improving I/O performance may cause other parts of the system to become bottlenecks. For example, unblocking threads might result in a higher volume of concurrent requests to shared resources, leading in turn to resource starvation or throttling. If that becomes a problem, you might need to scale out the number of web servers or partition data stores to reduce contention.

## How to Detect the Problem

### Symptoms

- The application may seem unresponsive periodically.
- The application might fail with timeout exceptions.
- Failures could return HTTP 500 (Internal Server) errors.
- Incoming client requests might be blocked until a thread becomes available, resulting in excessive request queue lengths, manifested as HTTP 503 (Service Unavailable) errors.

### Steps to Identify the Problem

1. **Monitor the production system** to determine whether blocked worker threads are constraining throughput.
2. **Review the application** to determine which operations may be performing I/O synchronously.
3. **Perform controlled load testing** of each operation that is performing synchronous I/O to find out whether those operations are affecting system performance.
