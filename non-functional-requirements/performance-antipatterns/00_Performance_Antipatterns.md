# Performance Antipatterns

Performance antipatterns, much like design patterns, are common defective processes and implementations within organizations. These practices are likely to cause scalability problems when an application is under pressure. Awareness of these practices can help simplify communication of high-level concepts among software practitioners, and knowledge of antipatterns can be helpful when reviewing code or diagnosing performance issues.

## Introduction

### What are Performance Antipatterns?

Performance antipatterns are recurring issues that degrade the performance of applications, especially under load. These issues often arise due to common but flawed practices in software development and deployment.

### Why are Performance Antipatterns Important?

Understanding performance antipatterns is crucial for:
- Diagnosing performance issues in production.
- Improving the scalability and reliability of applications.
- Facilitating better communication among software practitioners.

### Common Scenario

A typical scenario involves an application that performs well during testing but encounters performance issues in production. This discrepancy arises because it is challenging to simulate real user behavior and workloads accurately in a test environment.

#### Key Questions:
1. **Why didn't this behavior show up during testing?**
   - It's difficult to replicate real users' behavior and workload volumes in a test environment.
2. **How do we fix it?**
   - Fixing the issue requires identifying the root cause, often through instrumentation and logging, and understanding the specific antipattern involved.

## Catalog of Antipatterns

Here are some of the most common performance antipatterns observed, particularly in cloud environments like Microsoft Azure:

### 1. Busy Database

**Description:** Offloading too much processing to a data store.
- **Symptoms:** High database load, slow query performance.
- **Resolution:** Distribute processing tasks more evenly across the application architecture.

### 2. Busy Front End

**Description:** Moving resource-intensive tasks onto background threads.
- **Symptoms:** Slow UI response, high CPU usage on front-end servers.
- **Resolution:** Offload intensive tasks to back-end services or separate processing units.

### 3. Chatty I/O

**Description:** Continually sending many small network requests.
- **Symptoms:** Increased latency, higher network traffic.
- **Resolution:** Batch requests to reduce network overhead.

### 4. Extraneous Fetching

**Description:** Retrieving more data than is needed, resulting in unnecessary I/O.
- **Symptoms:** High I/O operations, slow data retrieval.
- **Resolution:** Fetch only the required data and avoid over-fetching.

### 5. Improper Instantiation

**Description:** Repeatedly creating and destroying objects that are designed to be shared and reused.
- **Symptoms:** Increased memory usage, frequent garbage collection.
- **Resolution:** Implement object pooling or reuse objects where applicable.

### 6. Monolithic Persistence

**Description:** Using the same data store for data with very different usage patterns.
- **Symptoms:** Bottlenecks in data access, reduced performance.
- **Resolution:** Segregate data stores based on usage patterns and optimize separately.

### 7. No Caching

**Description:** Failing to cache data.
- **Symptoms:** Frequent data retrieval from primary sources, increased load times.
- **Resolution:** Implement caching strategies to store frequently accessed data.

### 8. Noisy Neighbor

**Description:** A single tenant uses a disproportionate amount of the resources.
- **Symptoms:** Resource contention, performance degradation for other tenants.
- **Resolution:** Implement resource isolation and management strategies.

### 9. Retry Storm

**Description:** Retrying failed requests to a server too often.
- **Symptoms:** Increased server load, further failures.
- **Resolution:** Implement exponential backoff strategies for retries.

### 10. Synchronous I/O

**Description:** Blocking the calling thread while I/O completes.
- **Symptoms:** Reduced application throughput, increased latency.
- **Resolution:** Use asynchronous I/O operations to improve performance.

## Next Steps

- **Monitor and Diagnose:** Continuously monitor application performance in production and diagnose issues as they arise.
- **Apply Best Practices:** Adopt best practices for coding and architecture to avoid these antipatterns.
- **Learn and Adapt:** Stay informed about new performance antipatterns and evolving best practices.
