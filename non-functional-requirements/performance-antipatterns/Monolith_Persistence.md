# Monolithic Persistence Antipattern

## Introduction
The Monolithic Persistence antipattern involves putting all of an application's data into a single data store. This can hurt performance due to resource contention and mismatches between the data store and the data types.

## Problem Description
Historically, applications have often used a single data store to simplify design or match the development team's skill set. However, modern cloud-based systems have diverse requirements and data types, such as documents, images, cached data, queued messages, application logs, and telemetry.

Putting all this data into the same store can lead to:
- **Resource Contention**: Unrelated data sharing the same store can cause slow response times and connection failures.
- **Poor Fit**: The chosen data store might not be optimized for all data types and operations.

## How to Fix the Problem
Separate data according to its use and select the most appropriate data store for each type. For example:
- **Business Data**: Store in a relational database.
- **Log Data**: Store in a separate logging database.

This reduces resource contention and optimizes performance for each data type.

## Considerations
- **Data Usage and Access Patterns**: Different data types have different access requirements. For example, log data is sequential, while business data may require random access.
- **Scaling**: If you still reach database limits, consider scaling up or horizontally partitioning the load across servers, which may require redesigning the application.

## How to Detect the Problem
Systems experiencing the Monolithic Persistence antipattern typically slow down and may fail as they run out of resources.

### Steps to Identify the Problem:
1. **Record Key Performance Statistics**: Capture timing for operations and data access points.
2. **Monitor the System in Production**: Gather real-world usage data or run scripted load tests.
3. **Analyze Telemetry Data**: Identify periods of poor performance and correlate with data store access.
4. **Identify Resource Contention**: Look for data storage resources under high contention.
