# N-Tier Architecture in System Design

## Overview

N-tier or multitier architecture is a way of organizing and dividing the components of a computer system into distinct layers or tiers. The tiers can be defined based on the functionality of the components or the computing environment in which the system will run.

**Tiers** refer to physical partitions and are associated with multilayered architecture.

The three-tier design, which divides logic into the display, business, and data layers, is one of the most extensively used forms of layered architecture.

## Tiers vs. Layers


**Layers** are the logical separation, whereas tiers talk about the physical separation. Layers structure functionality and components when splitting application logic. Various layers don’t have to be located on separate physical computers, and numerous layers can exist in the same system.

**Tiers** concern the physical location of different components of the software system. In three-tiered architecture, the presentation, business, and data tiers are physically deployed on three separate machines.

## Layers in N-Tier Architecture

### Presentation Tier

- **Role**: Responsible for the application's user interface.
- **Importance**: This is the main part users see and interact with.
- **Focus**: Should prioritize usability and user-friendly design. Thin clients with minimal logic are preferred.
- **Functionality**: Presents data to the user and receives input.

### Business Tier

- **Role**: Implements the application’s business logic, including business rules, validations, and calculation logic.
- **Importance**: Acts as a bridge between the display and data levels.
- **Functionality**: Coordinates application logic, executes comprehensive procedures, and makes rational conclusions. Interacts with both the presentation and data tiers.

### Data Tier

- **Role**: Offers data access and management functions.
- **Components**: Includes a data store for persistent storage, such as a relational database management system.
- **Functionality**: Delivers data and services to the business tier.

## Purpose of N-Tier Architecture

The rise of the web corresponded with the transition from two-tier (client-server) to three-tier systems. Rich client applications incorporating business logic weren’t optimal with online apps and the use of web browsers. This three-tier design is more common with web applications because it provides a thin client. Moreover, there are currently architectures with more than three levels.

## Advantages

- **Secure**: Each tier can be easily secured.
- **Flexible**: The application can be extended in multiple ways.
- **Scalable**: Any single tier can be scaled or updated without affecting other tiers.
- **Improved Modularity**: Allows different components to be developed and maintained separately, making development more efficient.
- **Better Scalability**: Independent scaling of different tiers makes it easier to meet changing demands.
- **Increased Security**: Separates the presentation layer from the data storage layer, making it harder for attackers to access sensitive data.
- **Improved Maintainability**: Easier to make changes to one tier without affecting others.

## Disadvantages

- **Costly**: Hardware, network, and deployment costs are higher compared to other architectures.
- **Complexity**: More complex to implement due to multiple tiers and their integration.
- **Performance Overhead**: Additional layers of abstraction can lead to performance overhead due to data passing between tiers and extra processing.
- **Increased Development Time**: Takes longer to develop due to the need for multiple tiers and their integration.
