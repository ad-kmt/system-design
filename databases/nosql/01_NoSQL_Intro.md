# NoSQL Introduction

NoSQL databases are purpose-built for specific data models and stores data in flexible schemas that scale easily for modern applications.

## What is meant by Specific Data Models here ?
NoSQL databases are designed and optimized to work with particular types of data organization, patterns and relationships. This makes them more efficient for certain use cases.

Unlike traditional RDBMS, which uses a one-size-fits-all table-based structure, NoSQL databases are tailored to specific patterns and types of data interaction, making them more.

**Examples of some NoSQL Data Models:**
- Document Stores
- Key-Value Stores
- Wide-Column Stores
- Graph Databases
