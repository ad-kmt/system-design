# Key-Value Store

## Introduction
A key-value database is a type of non-relational database, also known as a NoSQL database, that uses a simple key-value method to store data. 

It stores data as a collection of key-value pairs in which a key serves as a unique identifier. Both keys and values can be anything, ranging from simple objects to complex compound objects.

Key-value databases (or key-value stores) are highly partitionable and allow horizontal scaling at a level that other types of databases cannot achieve.

## What are the Advantages of Key-Value Databases?
### Scalability
Key-value databases can scale horizontally, automatically distributing data across servers to reduce bottlenecks at a single server. This built-in support for advanced scaling features makes them highly efficient.

### Ease of Use
Key-value databases follow the object-oriented paradigm, allowing developers to map real-world objects directly to software objects. This makes them more intuitive for developers to use, as they can create key-value pairs that match their code objects without the need to map code objects to multiple underlying tables.

### Performance
Key-value databases process constant read-write operations with low-overhead server calls, improving latency and response time. They use simple, single-table structures rather than multiple interrelated tables, which enhances performance by eliminating resource-intensive table joins.

## What are the Use Cases of Key-Value Databases?
### Session Management
Key-value stores are ideal for session management in applications where each user session has a unique identifier. They store session data like profile information, messages, personalized data, and more, providing fast access and smaller per-page overhead than relational databases.

### Shopping Cart
E-commerce websites can handle large amounts of data and high volumes of state changes using key-value databases. These databases support distributed processing and storage, ensuring that millions of simultaneous users can be serviced efficiently.

### Metadata Storage Engine
Key-value stores can act as underlying storage layers for higher levels of data access, such as real-time video streaming, interactive content, and gaming platforms. They can handle high throughput and concurrency, making them suitable for media and entertainment workloads.

### Caching
Key-value databases are effective for storing data temporarily for faster retrieval. Social media applications, for instance, can use them to store frequently accessed data like news feed content, accelerating application responses.

## How Do Key-Value Databases Work?
Key-value databases organize data as a set of key-value pairs. The key serves as a unique identifier, while the value is the data associated with that key.

A primary key in a key-value database can be composite, comprising a partition key and a sort key. The partition key determines the partition where the item will be stored, and the sort key determines the order of items within the partition.

For example, a book data object may have attributes like title, author, and publishing date. Each book object has a key called BookID, which links directly to the book object in the key-value store. Data can be retrieved by looking up the BookID in the table.

## Features of Key-Value Databases
### Support for Complex Data Types
Key-value stores support not only basic data types like integers and text but also more complex objects like arrays, nested dictionaries, images, and videos. This flexibility allows for optimization in storage and query performance.

### No Need for Table Joins
Key-value databases do not require resource-intensive table joins, as all necessary information can be accommodated in a single table. This contributes to their high performance.

### Sorted Keys
Key-value stores can sort keys systematically for efficient data storage and partitioning. For instance, keys can be sorted alphabetically, numerically, chronologically, or by data size.

### Secondary Key Support
Some key-value stores allow the definition of multiple keys or secondary indexes to access the same data. This provides flexibility in how data can be retrieved.

### Replication
Key-value stores often include built-in replication support, automatically copying data across multiple storage nodes to ensure data availability and recovery in case of server failures.

### Partitioning
Partitioning distributes data across nodes, improving application availability and reliability. Some key-value databases provide automatic support for distributing data across multiple geographical locations.

### ACID Support
Advanced key-value databases offer native support for ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), ensuring data accuracy and reliability in all circumstances. This simplifies the developer experience of making coordinated changes to multiple items within and across tables.

## What are the Limitations of Key-Value Databases?
### Absence of Complex Queries
Key-value databases do not support complex queries. Data operations are limited to simple query terms like get, put, and delete. This limitation requires developers to implement workarounds in the application code.

### Schema Mismanagement
The absence of enforced schemas in key-value stores means that developers must plan the data model carefully to avoid long-term issues. The application is responsible for the proper interpretation of the data, often referred to as 'schema on read'.
