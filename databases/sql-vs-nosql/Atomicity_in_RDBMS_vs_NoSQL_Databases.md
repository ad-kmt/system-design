# Atomicity in RDBMS vs. NoSQL Databases

Understanding atomicity in traditional Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) compared to NoSQL databases helps clarify how each type of database ensures data integrity during transactions.

## Atomicity in Traditional RDBMS

Traditional RDBMS apply atomicity across the entire scope of a transaction, which can include multiple operations across various tables and rows. This means:

- **Full Transaction Scope**: Every operation within the transaction boundary either completes entirely or is entirely undone. If a transaction includes multiple SQL statements affecting multiple rows and tables, all these changes are treated as a single unit.
- **Example**: If a transaction involves transferring money from one bank account to another, it would typically update two rows (one in each account). Both updates must succeed to maintain atomicity. If any part of this transaction fails, all changes are rolled back, including all affected rows across all involved tables.

## Atomicity in NoSQL Databases

In contrast, some NoSQL databases limit atomicity to the level of a single document or row. This approach includes:

- **Single Row/Document**: Changes to a single row or document are fully applied or not applied at all. This atomicity does not extend to multiple documents or rows.
- **Example in NoSQL Contexts**:
    - **MongoDB**: Before version 4.0, MongoDB ensured atomic operations only within the scope of a single document. If a document update involves changing several fields within that document, either all field updates are applied, or none are, but this guarantee didn’t extend to multiple documents.
    - **Cassandra**: Similar to MongoDB’s earlier versions, Cassandra ensures atomicity at the level of a single row (especially within the same partition). Batch updates in Cassandra can be atomic within the same partition but not across partitions.

## Comparison Between RDBMS and NoSQL

- **Scope and Scale**: Traditional RDBMS ensure atomicity for all operations within a transaction, affecting any number of tables or rows. Some NoSQL databases, however, originally provided atomicity only within the confines of a single document or row.
- **Transactional Integrity**: RDBMS are typically more suitable for applications that require complex transactional integrity across multiple entities, such as in financial services, due to their comprehensive support for atomic transactions.
- **Use Cases**: The differing approaches to atomicity reflect the typical use cases for each type of database system. RDBMS are favored in scenarios needing strict consistency and transactional integrity, while NoSQL may be chosen for high-volume, scalable environments where single document or row atomicity is sufficient.

## Evolving Features in NoSQL

The development of features in NoSQL databases, like MongoDB's support for multi-document transactions starting from version 4.0, indicates a trend towards incorporating more traditional RDBMS-like transactional features, while still aiming to retain scalability and flexibility advantages.

This comparison illustrates how the concept of atomicity is adapted to meet the specific needs and constraints of different database architectures.
