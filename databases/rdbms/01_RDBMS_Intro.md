# What are Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)

## What is Relational Model
The relational model organizes data into tables:
- each **row** representing an individual record
- each **column** consisting of attributes that contain values.

This tabular database structure makes it easy to establish relationships between data points so that the information can be accessed in a variety of different ways without reorganizing the data itself. e.g. JOINS

## What is a Relational Database
A relational database is a collection of data points with pre-defined relationships between them following relational model.

## What is a RDBMS
A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a software layer of tools and services that manages relational tables.
