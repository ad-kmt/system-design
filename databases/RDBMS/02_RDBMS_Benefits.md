# What are the benefits of a relational database

The primary benefit of the relational data model is essentially the ability to derive meaningful information from data.

**Example**:
We can count, sort, and group data in a table, as well as perform mathematical operations and generate complex reports.

More technical benefits below.

## Data integrity
Data integrity is the overall completeness, accuracy, and consistency of data. Relational databases use a set of constraints to enforce data integrity in the database.

**These includes**:
- Primary Key
- Foreign Key
- Not NULL constraint
- Unique constraint
- Default constraint
- Check constraints.

These integrity constraints help enforce business rules on data in the tables to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data.

## Security
RDBMS have sophisticated access controls. Database administrators can precisely determine who gets what access to which data.

**Example**:
You can limit access to read, modify, and delete data even at the individual cell level.

Such granular access control makes relational databases very secure.

## Backup and disaster recovery
Most relational databases have import and export functionality, so you can quickly create data backups.

## Ease of use
Through SQL and high-level interfaces.
