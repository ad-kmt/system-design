# Web Server vs Application Server

Web servers and application servers are essential technologies that enable the exchange of data and services over the internet. Understanding the differences between these two types of servers is crucial for designing and deploying web applications effectively.

## What is a Web Server?

A web server is a software component responsible for delivering static content like images, files, and text in response to client requests. When you visit a website, your browser (client) requests data from a remote server, which then displays the response.

### How a Web Server Works

1. **URL Request**: The browser uses the URL to find the server’s IP address.
2. **HTTP Request**: The browser sends an HTTP request for information.
3. **Data Retrieval**: The web server communicates with a database server to find the relevant data.
4. **Content Delivery**: The web server returns static content such as HTML pages, images, videos, or files in an HTTP response to the browser.
5. **Display**: The browser displays the information to the user.

Web servers are suitable for hosting websites that mainly deliver static content, such as blogs, images, and articles.

## What is an Application Server?

An application server extends the capabilities of a web server by supporting dynamic content generation, application logic, and integration with various resources. It provides a runtime environment for running application code and interacting with other software components like messaging systems and databases.

### How an Application Server Works

1. **URL Request**: The browser uses the URL to find the server’s IP address.
2. **HTTP Request**: The browser sends an HTTP request for information.
3. **Request Transfer**: The web server transfers the request to the application server.
4. **Business Logic**: The application server applies business logic and communicates with other servers and third-party systems to fulfill the request.
5. **Content Rendering**: The application server renders a new HTML page and returns it as a response to the web server.
6. **Content Delivery**: The web server returns the response to the browser.
7. **Display**: The browser displays the information to the user.

Application servers are essential for interactive websites where dynamic content, such as user-specific data and real-time updates, is required.

## Key Differences: Web Server vs. Application Server

### Tasks Covered

- **Web Server**: Hosts websites and delivers responses to simple requests. It also logs server activity and supports server-side scripting.
- **Application Server**: Handles business logic to generate dynamic content by connecting with enterprise systems, services, and databases.

### Protocols Used

- **Web Server**: Primarily uses the HTTP protocol. Also supports FTP and SMTP for file storage, transfer, and email.
- **Application Server**: Uses additional communication protocols like remote method invocation (RMI) and remote procedure call (RPC) alongside those used by web servers.

### Content Types

- **Web Server**: Delivers static content such as HTML pages, images, videos, and files.
- **Application Server**: Delivers dynamic content such as real-time updates, personalized information, and customer support.

### Multithreading

- **Web Server**: Typically does not use multithreading. It manages concurrent connections using non-blocking I/O and event-driven architecture.
- **Application Server**: Uses multithreading to process requests concurrently, providing high scalability and efficiency.

## How They Work Together

Web servers and application servers often work together to handle client requests and deliver the correct content. The web server receives the request first and, if possible, fulfills it directly. If not, it forwards the request to the application server, which processes the data and applies business logic to provide the appropriate response.

### Summary of Differences

| Aspect            | Web Server                                               | Application Server                                               |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Tasks Covered** | Delivers responses to simple requests                    | Delivers complex content from databases, services, and systems   |
| **Protocols Used**| HTTP, FTP, SMTP                                          | HTTP, FTP, SMTP, RMI, RPC, and more                              |
| **Content Types** | Static content (HTML, images, videos, files)             | Dynamic content (real-time updates, personalized information)    |
| **Multithreading**| Does not typically use multithreading                    | Uses multithreading to process requests concurrently             |
